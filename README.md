# DownTube :guardsman:
A program to download videos from YouTube. Basically I created this so I can download 
YouTube videos easily. Why not use a browser extension to download videos from YouTube? Because 
I can't use browser extensions on my phone. Plus, I'm a noob so I think this is a good beginner project.

# Requirements :guardsman:
pytube (to download the YouTube videos)

argparse (for parsing arguments)

colorama (for colors)

os (Default on python)

time (Default on python)

# Download :guardsman:
open terminal (make sure you have git installed from terminal)
>>> https://github.com/Computatrums/DownTube.git
>>> cd DownTube
>>> pip install -r requirements.txt
