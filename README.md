# DownTube
A program to download videos from YouTube. Basically I created this so I can easily download 
YouTube videos easily. Why not use a browser extension to download videos from YouTube? Because 
I can't use browser extensions on my phone. Plus, I'm a noob so I think this is a good beginner project.

# Requirements
pytube (to download the YouTube videos)
argparse (for parsing arguments)
colorama (for colors)
os (Default on python)
time (Default on python)
